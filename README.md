# Breast Cancer Prediction - Data Mining Project

This project focuses on predicting the presence of breast cancer in patients using a classification model based on data mining techniques. The dataset contains various features related to cell properties extracted from breast tissue samples.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model that accurately predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on a set of medical attributes. The dataset includes measurements such as cell thickness, uniformity of cell size and shape, and other features that help in determining the nature of the tumor.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of the following columns:

- **ID number**: Unique identifier for each patient.
- **Clump Thickness**: Thickness of the cell clumps.
- **Uniformity of Cell Size**: Consistency in cell size.
- **Uniformity of Cell Shape**: Consistency in cell shape.
- **Marginal Adhesion**: The tendency of the cells to stick to each other.
- **Single Epithelial Cell Size**: Size of the single epithelial cells.
- **Bare Nuclei**: Nuclei that are not surrounded by cytoplasm.
- **Bland Chromatin**: Texture of the chromatin in the cell nucleus.
- **Normal Nucleoli**: Normal nucleoli count.
- **Mitoses**: Rate of cell division.
- **Class**: The target variable, indicating if the tumor is benign (2) or malignant (4).

## Required Libraries

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of data mining techniques to predict breast cancer based on cellular characteristics. The model serves as a tool to assist in the early detection of breast cancer, which is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes.
